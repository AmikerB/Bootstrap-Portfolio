# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This [portfolio]() was built on the [previous portfolio](https://amikerb.github.io/Portfolio/) I created however, this portfolio I focused on the use of Bootstrap. This responsive webpage showcases the web applications I have created to potential employers. The webpage features a navigation bar at the top, a hero section, an about me section, a portfolio section, an email contact form and finally a contact me footer with clickable links to my various social networks. The portfolio section has clickable tiles with links to my web applications, these tiles have shadows when the cursor hovers over them.
